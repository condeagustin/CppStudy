# CppStudy
This is my personal project in Visual Studio Code for studying intensively a lot of the features of C++, including, C++11, C++14 and some things about C++17

You can set up VS Code to compile and run C++ projects by checking https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/10/24/building-your-c-application-with-visual-studio-code/. I created  Test/build.bat to configure the compiler, flags, linker, etc

Remember that the purpose of this project is to study only. Do not expect order or fancy designs or architectures. All the code is placed under Test/main.cpp and the entry point of execution is the function int main(). Some code sections are commented to explain the concept of what is being done. Apologies for not being more organized, but again, the only purpose is to study and understand details about C++.

These are the amazing sources/books I have been studying and coding from:

1. http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/
2. https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features
3. **Effective Modern C++**. Once you know the basics of C++, this books easily explains the modern features. It's very cool!
4. https://www.sololearn.com/Play/CPlusPlus. I downloaded the Learn C++ mobile app to do the code challenges against other users. It's very fun and I have learned a lot
